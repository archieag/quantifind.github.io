We're looking for someone well rounded to join our Engineering team and help keep our systems running smoothly. You should be comfortable in the datacenter deploying a new network architecture one day and troubleshooting Hadoop performance problems the next. Some of the projects you might work on include systems level architecture, deploying and configuring new technologies, and build/test/deploy automation. You should work well in a team and communicate effectively while juggling tasks with different priorities.

Desired skills include:
* Significant experience with systems level monitoring (sar, vmstat, iostat, etc.) and higher level frameworks (nagios, cacti, etc.).
* Significant experience with performance troubleshooting.
* Significant experience with systems level architecture and able to articulate tradeoffs around memory/cpu/network/disk for different applications.
* Experience with automation software (puppet, chef, ansible, etc.)
* Basic scripting/coding experience
* Previous "big data" (Hadoop, Spark, etc.) experience a plus but not required
* Highly data driven, uses data to predict potential scaling limitations and propose solutions.
* Racking, stacking, cabling -- should be a small part of the job and something you can hire for/contract out over time.
* Basic IT work -- setting up new hires, deploying LDAP, etc.; again something you can offload over time.
