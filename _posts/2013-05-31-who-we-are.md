**We are Quantifind**, a startup founded by two Stanford physicists intent on disrupting the way big data is used for predictive analytics. "Big data" is a buzzword right now but most companies outside the Valley aren't using their data to drive meaningful value. At Quantifind we're solving that problem by building enterprise products to find actionable knowledge in customer data. Our first product helps companies understand the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns. As one example, we help major Hollywood movie studios maximize their ticket sales through audience identification and marketing optimization. We're not restricting ourselves to advertising, however -- over time we see a wide open landscape where our techniques and technology can help organizations make better decisions to optimize their most important business metrics.

We’re funded by top tier Silicon Valley venture firms (USVP, Redpoint Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and AME Cloud Ventures). Our product is actively serving the premiere brand names in a rapidly increasing number of verticals.
