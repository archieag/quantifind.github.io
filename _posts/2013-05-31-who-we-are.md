**We are Quantifind**, a technology and analytics startup founded by two physicists from Stanford University. We're funded by venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures, and US Venture Partners.

Our team has a singular focus: to build products and pioneer algorithms that bridge the divide between big data and actual business decisions. We work with our customers to identify their critical business outcomes, like revenue, and deliver products that pinpoint the key levers that drive those outcomes. Our clients span multiple industries including movie studios, telecom, and consumer packaged goods.

We've done all that -- and also recruited a seasoned management team who came to us from Facebook, Twitter, Google, Adobe, McKinsey, and OMD -- all while operating without external publicity. Our team and business are both growing quickly.
