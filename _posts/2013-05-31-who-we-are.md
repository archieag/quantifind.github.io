**We are Quantifind**, a startup founded by two Stanford physicists intent on disrupting the way big data is used for predictive analytics. Our team of Data Scientists, Software Engineers, and Designers distills large, complex streams of data into a powerfully simple product that provides deep insight into a customer's past performance, and recommends strategies for optimizing the one metric that matters to our customers: future revenue.

We’re funded by top tier Silicon Valley venture firms (Redpoint Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz) and our product is actively serving the premiere brand names in a rapidly increasing number of verticals.
