**We are Quantifind**, founded by two Stanford atomic physicists with a strong appetite for changing the way data is used for business intelligence. Our team of Data Scientists, Software Engineers, Designers and Analysts has discovered how to extract knowledge from big data in a way that provides radically different insights into both past and future.
 
We're funded by top tier Silicon Valley VCs, Redpoint Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, and we've already dived deeply into market verticals with a disruptive product that's working for many large companies you've undoubtedly heard of.
