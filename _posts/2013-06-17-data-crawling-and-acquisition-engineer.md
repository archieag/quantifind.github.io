At Quantifind we are looking for engineers with a passion for building highly performant, scalable systems. As Data Crawling and Acquisition Engineer (a.k.a., our Data Wrangler) you will be responsible for pulling in massive amounts of data from the web and a large number of structured and unstructured sources, and feeding it all into our big data machine.

We believe that the web is the greatest data source in the world, especially when coupled with exclusive high value data feeds that we have acquired.  We are looking for like-minded souls to help us acquire, parse, and process this data to deliver tangible value to both our internal team and our customers.  We know that is not always an easy task to manage, and requires creativity, tenacity, and perseverance; should you be equal to the challenge then weâ€™d love to hear from you.

If you are looking to work at a company where you design, build, and feed the foundation of an entire data ecosystem, then Quantifind is for you.
