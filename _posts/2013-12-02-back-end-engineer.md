The Backend Engineering team at Quantifind owns all the infrastructure that powers our business. We need scalable, performant architectures to process terabytes of data each day and also realtime systems to support our interactive products. We're working with cutting edge technologies like Scala and Spark alongside more traditional big data systems like Hadoop. You're not building a platform at Quantifind, you'll be working closely with our Data Scientists and Frontend Engineers to build a product that finds actionable knowledge for our customers by processing massive datasets.

Desired skills include:
* Excellent coding skills (bonus if you're familiar with Scala).
* Experience with Hadoop, Spark, or other map-reduce technologies.
* Distributed systems expertise.
* Experience with storage and caching solutions and the tradeoffs among them (Memcache, Redis, Postgres, MySQL, Elastic Search, Cassandra, etc.)
* Great communication skills so you can work with our data scientists and frontend engineers.
* Version control experience in Git or a similar system.
